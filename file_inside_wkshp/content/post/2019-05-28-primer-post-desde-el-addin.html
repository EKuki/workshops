<p>Un poco de Rmarkdown para ver que pasa</p>
<p>To understand how R works, you are going to use it as a simple calcuator.
You can get output in the Console simply by typing math in the script and running it:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>3+5 # From the pound sign to the right, this is a comment. I am asking R to sum 3 plus 5</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 8</code></pre>
<p>Now, we divide 12 by 6 and write a comment explaining what we are doing</p>
<pre class="r"><code>12/6 # I am now dividing 12 by 6. The solution is 2</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 2</code></pre>
<div id="basics-r" class="section level1">
<h1>1.Basics R</h1>
<div id="first-steps" class="section level2">
<h2>First steps</h2>
To write a comment, type <code>#</code> before the sentence you want to write.
Anything to the right of a <code>#</code> in a script will be ignored by R.
To run any line (or lines), click anywhere on the line you want to run and either 1) click <code>Ctr</code> + <code>Enter</code> or 2) click on the run bottom (up right corner of Source/Script in Rstudio)
<div id="print-weight-hint">
<p><strong>Hint:</strong> If you want to run several lines, highlight them all and do as explained above.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
